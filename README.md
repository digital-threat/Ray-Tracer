# Vulkan Ray Tracer
Real-time Whitted-style ray tracer built with Vulkan ray tracing extensions. This repository started out as a general purpose game engine, which I was writing as part of the specializion course at Futuregames. I ripped out the forward renderer, as well as some other bits, and continued working on the project pivoting towards building a ray tracing engine. .
